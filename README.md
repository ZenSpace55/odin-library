# odin-library
## About
Made for the Library project for The Odin Project. Stores and displays an array of books, keeping track of which books the user has read. The background photo is by Alfons Morales, released under Usplash license. I edited the photo to make it blend into the page.

## To-Do
While the format does support reasonably long book titles, there is currently no character constraint on the titles, author names, or year.  And there is no check that the user is entering valid data into the 'Add book' form.
